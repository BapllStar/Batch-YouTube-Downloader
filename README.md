## Usage

To use this program, follow the instructions below:

1. Create a text file and copy/paste the YouTube video links you want to download. Each link should be on a new line.
2. Format the links using one of the following formats:
   - `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<id>`
   - `https://youtu.be/<id>`
3. Optional: Add comments using the `#` symbol. Comments will be ignored by the program.
4. Optional: Add headings using the `##` prefix. Headings will be displayed in the console when processed.
5. Optional: Trim the audio of specific videos using the trimming syntax. The syntax is `& xh,xm,xs - xh,xm,xs`, where `x` represents hours, minutes, or seconds.
   - You can use multiple commands on a single line by separating them with `&`.
   - If you want to cut from a specific point until the end, use `end` instead of the second timestamp.
6. Save the file with a `.txt` extension.

Example:

```plaintext
##Headlines will show up in the console, when the program is running
#Comments and epty lines will be completely ignored

# Below is an example for how to make a download list:

## Downloading audio
# Literally just insert the links line separated. That's it...

## Trimming Audio
# You can cut out specific parts of a video by using the syntax demonstrated below:
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
& 0s - 5s& 10s - 1m,5s& 2m - end
# This will cut out:
#   The first 5 seconds (&  - 5s)
#   From 00:10 to 01:05 (& 10s - 1m,5s)
#   from 02:00 until the end (& 2m - end)

## Alternative trimming syntax
# The trimming post (the time mark) is by default 0s. This makes you able to write "" in place of "0s", "0m" or "0h". See example below.

&  - 7s
# ^ Mind you, there are 2 spaces here.

The above example code works. You can run it through the program if you want to try it.
